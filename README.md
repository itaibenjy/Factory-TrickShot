# Factory-TrickShot
My first Pygame game I built during the first year of my software engineer studies.(I am aware the code is a mess but is the first big project I did that is why I kept it in my latest project is [YouTube Downloader](https://github.com/itaibenjy/Youtube-Downloader))

The game is a puzzle like game with shooting mechanics, there are 3 weapons each with there own mechanics and balistics (the projectile move differently).

The game have an orginized menu and the player control the menu by shooting the right option.

The target of this game is to hit the red and white target block with whatever weapon you choose (some levels require you to use a certain weapon in order to complete them).

There are different kind of blocks like trampolines, portals and launchers that make this game intresting and fun to play.

I made a graphic level editor that is easy to use and let you play the level before saving it. The save button will save the level automaticlly as a csv with the right name (the next level number).
